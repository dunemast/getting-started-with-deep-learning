Algorithms and Deep learning Models for Time Series data

## Introduction

Imperical and Deep learning algorithms for time series analysis and forecasting.

## Models

**Parametric methods**, in this approach, the task is to estimate the parameters of the model that describes the stochastic process.

**Non Parametric methods**, this approach explicitly estimate the covariance or the spectrum of the process without assuming that the process has any particular structure.
